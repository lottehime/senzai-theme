## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have any reason to believe that there are security vulnerabilities across any repository in the organisation, please report to [@vector_cmdr](https://x.com/vector_cmdr) via a direct message.

I will endeavour to respond within 2 - 3 business days.

If the report is confirmed to be true, we will make the necessary changes required to fix the issue. I will deploy a patch as soon as reasonably possible depending on the type of port and complexity of the issue.
